## Repository Overview

RustLens is a monorepo with three services:

| App | Stack | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `apps/backend` | Go 1.24 (chi, pgx, go-redis) | API server and shard coordinator for bot workers |
| `apps/frontend` | Next.js 14 (React 18, TypeScript) | Web UI |
| `apps/bot` | Discord.js (TypeScript, ESM) | Sharded worker runtime |

Orchestrated with **pnpm 10 workspaces** + **Turborepo**. The Go backend is outside the pnpm workspace graph but integrated via the root `dev:all` script and Makefile targets.

## Common Commands

All commands run from the repo root unless noted.

```bash
make doctor          # Verify toolchain (Node, pnpm, Go, Docker, etc.)
make setup           # pnpm install + go mod tidy + install Air
make dev             # Start infra (Postgres, Redis, Traefik) + hot-reload all three apps
make infra-up        # Start only infra containers
make infra-down      # Stop infra containers
```

### Per-service dev

```bash
make dev-backend     # Air hot-reload for Go backend
make dev-frontend    # Next.js dev server on :3000
make dev-bot         # tsx watch for bot
```

### Lint / Test / Build

```bash
make lint            # pnpm lint (TS type-check) + go vet
make test            # pnpm test (vitest) + go test
make build           # pnpm build (Next.js + tsc) + go build
```

### Running a single app's tests

```bash
# Go (supports ./... and package-level patterns)
cd apps/backend && go test ./internal/shards/...

# TypeScript (vitest)
pnpm --filter @rustlens/frontend test
pnpm --filter @rustlens/bot test
```

### Lint details

- **Frontend & Bot**: `tsc --noEmit` (type-check only, no ESLint).
- **Backend**: `go vet ./...`

## Architecture

### Routing (Traefik)

Local dev runs Traefik on `http://localhost`:

- `/api/*` -> backend on `:8080`
- Everything else -> frontend on `:3000`

Production uses the same split via Kubernetes Ingress (`deploy/k8s/ingress.yaml`).

### Backend (Go)

```
apps/backend/
  cmd/server/main.go        # Entrypoint: config -> stores -> service -> router -> server
  internal/
    config/config.go         # Env-based config with defaults (PORT, POSTGRES_URL, REDIS_URL, etc.)
    http/
      router.go              # chi routes: /api/docs, /api/healthz, /api/internal/bot/shards/*
      handlers.go            # Handler implementations incl. bot setup-state endpoints
      openapi.go             # Embedded OpenAPI spec + Scalar docs UI
    auth/jwt.go              # JWT signing/validation for bot service auth
    shards/
      service.go             # Shard coordination business logic
      allocator.go           # Shard assignment algorithm
      heartbeat.go           # Heartbeat/lease management
    store/
      postgres.go            # pgx pool + schema auto-migration (bot_worker_events table)
      redis.go               # go-redis client for heartbeats and shard leases
```

Key patterns:

- Schema is auto-migrated at startup via `EnsureSchema()` (no migration tool).
- Bot routes (`/api/internal/bot/shards/*`) are JWT-protected via middleware.
- Bot setup-state routes (`/api/internal/bot/setup/guilds/*`) are JWT-protected and persist one-time guild setup state in Postgres, including selected roles and selected channels.
- OpenAPI spec is served at `/api/docs/openapi.json`; interactive docs at `/api/docs`.

### Bot (TypeScript)

```
apps/bot/src/
  index.ts              # Entrypoint: config -> register -> poll assignments -> manage shards
  config.ts             # Env config loader
  backend-client.ts     # HTTP client for backend shard API (register, heartbeat, release, assignments)
  shards.ts             # Shard reconciliation logic
  shard-runtime.ts      # discord.js ShardingManager wrapper
  shard-worker.ts       # Individual shard worker process + interaction handling
  setup-command.ts      # /setup start command + setup modal handling
```

Flow: worker registers with backend -> polls `/assignments` -> reconciles local discord.js shards -> heartbeats leases -> releases on shutdown. Auth via self-signed JWT using `BOT_SERVICE_JWT_SECRET`.
Command flow: shard `0` registers `/setup start` and `/admin reset_setup` at startup. `/setup start` opens a modal with role and channel checkboxes, creates configured guild roles in a fixed order, creates the selected channel/category layout with permission overwrites, tries to set `#join` as the guild system channel for join messages when that channel is created, and stores per-guild setup state via backend bot-only endpoints. Channel creation only bootstraps from a guild that still has exactly one existing channel, and the command must be run in that channel because setup replaces it. `/admin reset_setup` clears that state and deletes the roles and channels created by setup.

### Frontend (Next.js)

Minimal at this stage. Source in `apps/frontend/src/`.

## Infrastructure

Local infra is defined in `infra/docker-compose.yml`:

- **Postgres 16** on `:5432` (user/pass/db: `rustlens`)
- **Redis 7** on `:6379`
- **Traefik v3** on `:80` (HTTP) and `:8081` (dashboard)

## Environment Variables

Each app has a `.env.example` — copy and fill before running. Key backend config with defaults:

| Variable | Default |
|---|---|
| `PORT` | `8080` |
| `POSTGRES_URL` | `postgres://rustlens:rustlens@localhost:5432/rustlens?sslmode=disable` |
| `REDIS_URL` | `redis://localhost:6379/0` |
| `BOT_SERVICE_JWT_SECRET` | `dev-bot-secret` |
| `BOT_TARGET_SHARDS` | `4` |
| `BOT_HEARTBEAT_TTL_SECONDS` | `45` |

The bot requires a real `DISCORD_TOKEN` for gateway login.

## CI/CD

- **`.github/workflows/ci.yml`** — On PR and push to `main`: lint/test/build for JS workspace, vet/test/build for Go backend, dry-run validate K8s manifests. Runs on self-hosted runners.
- **`.github/workflows/publish.yml`** — On `main`: builds and pushes `backend`, `frontend`, `bot` Docker images to GHCR.

## Skills

Agent skills live in `.agents/skills/` (symlinked to `.claude/skills/` for Claude Code). Each skill is a directory with a `SKILL.md` file. When creating or editing skills, always write to `.agents/skills/` — the symlink ensures all agent tooling picks them up.

Current skills:

| Skill | Description |
|---|---|
| `battlemetrics-api` | BattleMetrics REST API reference (endpoints, auth, pagination, JSON:API shapes) |

## Kubernetes

Manifests in `deploy/k8s/`. Apply in order: namespace -> configmap -> secrets -> backend -> frontend -> bot -> hpa -> ingress.
